# Introduction #
This script will help gather information from a Windows host that can help identify malicious programs or processes.  The script just stitches together a lot of built-in Windows commands like WMIC and NETSTAT along with 3rd party applications (must be downloaded) like NMAP and AutoRuns to give admins a first look at a possibly infected machine.
